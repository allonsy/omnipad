Omnipad is a program written in java.
Dependencies: most up to date java (at least 7)
to run, in windows or mac, double click on the jar icon, it should auto run
in linux/BSD or if the above fails, run: "java -jar OmniPad.jar" from a
UNIX-based command line (as always, make sure you are in the right directory).

omnipad is a geometry sketchpad, it isn't super fancy but if there are features you would like to see, let me know.

contact me with any questions! linuxbash8@gmail.com
